# Git Test Framework

Automated test framework for testing Git tool. Written in Python,
uses PyTest as a test runner. As this is a demo project, test coverage
is restricted to very few and basic Git functionalities.

The framework is designed to be able to cover most of the Git functionalities.
It is also created to be easily extendable to support Git functionalities that
might not be capable now.

Tests can be executed in Docker container, making it suitable for CI/CD integration.

### Structure

| Framework structure |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| log                 | Holds `gtf.log` file, the main (and only) log file of the framework. There could be backups as well, as it rotates on 100KB (configurable in `src/config.py`).                                                                                                                    |
| output              | Executed scenarios are kept here, as an output of the test execution. Each scenario represents one test case, and each of them holds one or many repos with all files used for testing.                                                                                           |
| results             | JSON file with test execution results (test status, duration, etc)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| scenario_artefacts  | Files used within testing scenarios. `scenario_artefacts/files` are files that are being added to the repo, modified and then performed Git action on them. `scenario_artefacts/expected_files` are files used to compare complex scenario outputs, as `merge conflict` scenario. |
| scripts             | Helpful scripts, not directly related to the framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| src                 | Source files, framework core and complete logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| tests               | Test cases for testing Git.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| unit                | Unit tests for testing code in `src` folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| scenario.py      | Scenario represents one test scenario, for instance 'merge'. It holds necessary repos and files for fulfilling the scenario. It contains methods for repo initialisation, clone, and to list the files.                                                                                                                      |
| repo.py          | Repo is a single repo within a Scenario. It can be local or remote, and there can be many of them, depending of the scenario (for 'submodule' there are four, two local, two remote repos). It contains the main logic of the framework, methods to run git commands, add file to the repo, compare with expected file, etc. |
| file.py          | File abstracts a file in the repo. It is the pointer to the file that is being managed with Git. It contains method for change the file content (append text, replace specific line), and to compare with another File.                                                                                                      |
| response.py      | Response is helping to catch and assert response message from Git command execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| logger.py        | Holds code for logging the actions to `log/gtf.log` file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| exceptions.py    | Custom framework exceptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| config.py        | Configurable items, mostly paths to the scenario artefacts, scenario outputs, log level and git user config.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Workflow
One test case tests one Git scenario. Each test case is independent and can be executed isolated or in parallel.
Scenario class abstracts Git scenario and one or more Git repos. Each time
scenario is created, new folder structure in `output` folder is created that follows scenario name. It can be
chosen how many and of which type repos will be created for a single scenario. For this purpose, there is a Repo class,
abstracting one code repositorium, local or remote. The main function of the Repo is to be able to execute Git
console commands, and to manipulate with files â€” add a new file to the repo, get the file from the repo, get
expected file, etc. To be easier to handle the file, there is File class. Its purpose is to help update
the file content and to compare it with another file of type File. Finally, each Git console command
response is captured in Response class, which helps us to assert the terminal output precisely.

### Assertion types
Specific assertion types are available to cover important aspects of git functionalities.

| Type            | Method                       | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Response        | contains(text)               | Verifies that Git command console output contains the text.                                                                                                  |
|                 | has(text, on_line, is_regex) | Verifies that Git command console output has the exact text on the specific output line. Optionally, regex can be used for matching.                         |
| File comparison | file_1 == file_2             | Generates the hash code for each file and compares it. Useful to check if the final file, after modifications and conflicts resolved, has expected content.  |
| Head reference  | get_heads_ref(branch)        | Get the repo head reference for given branch. Useful to check if local and remote branches are having the same content, after pull/push and similar actions. |
| Folder items    | list_folder_items(path)      | List the content of the folder. Useful to check if repo contains all expected files.                                                                         |
| Config          | get_config_value(key)        | Each repo, local or remote, has it's config. This function helps us to verify the config content, for instance, if local points to expected origin.          |


## Test plan

### Phase I (current state)
Implement tests with Priority 1 (P1) / most commonly used Git functionalities. Test coverage should be focused only on
positive scenarios, not going into negative or edge cases, making sure that a crucial Git feature works
within its basic usage.

Example scenario - `git merge`:
- On `main` branch create a `merge_file` file and commit it
- Create `second` branch, and checkout to it
- Update `merge_file` file content, commit it to `second` branch
- Checkout `main` branch and perform `git merge second`
- Assert that `merge_file` is merged correctly

The given example shows basic usage of common and crucial Git functionality. Focus was not on the idea
to break it, but rather to make sure it works as expected. This is the general purpose of Phase I.

Current test coverage:
- init: `init local` repo, `init server` repo
- state: `status`, `diff`, `log`
- branch: `create`, `checkout`, `commit`, `merge` (without conflicts), `merge` (with conflicts)
- remote: `clone`, `push`, `fetch`, `pull`, `submodule`

### Phase II
Implement tests with P2 priority, which covers the same functionalities as in Phase I, but this time to cover
more use cases around single functionality. For instance, speking of `git merge`, one of the new scenarios 
could be with several updated files accross remote and local branches, with conflicts. `submodule` should
cover nested submodules, that should use `--recursive` option to be updated.

Test coverage should be also expanded on less important or less frequent functionalities, e.g.,
rebase, tag, stash, undo changes, head reset, cherry-pick, etc. Like in Phase I, only the basic usage of these
less important functionalities should be covered.

The idea behind Phase II is to verify that important P1 functionalities work with most use case variations,
and also to widen coverage with basic usage of P2 functionalities.

### General notes
The purpose of automated tests in general is to maintain the stability and functionality of the product.
The test coverage should not go into too many details, as it takes time to implement, while missing the 
purpose of the automation. Testing new functionality in details is the best using exploratory manual testing
during the feature implementation.

Since Git is already implemented app, and we missed exploratory testing, we still shouldn't cover 
that missing part with automated tests. We should rather make a new plan for deep manual exploratory testing 
for catching bugs.

### System requirements for CI/CD
This framework can be executed within Docker container, making it suitable to run on various system configurations.

It is mandatory to have Docker installed with access to the internet if building Docker images happens at the 
time of the test execution. If Docker image is pre-built and kept on local hub / repo, internet access is not needed.
It is recommended to have a Linux platform for docker container executon, even though it should be 
working fine with Mac and Windows.

This configuration of Docker container is capable of running on most of the popular CI/CD tools, like 
GitHub Actions pipeline, GitLab pipeline, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline, Buildkite, etc.

Example of the GitHub pipeline file (not tested, its sample):
```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml

name: git-tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t gtf-docker:latest .

      - name: Run tests in Docker container
        run: docker run --rm gtf-docker:latest pytest
```


## Development notes
### Challenges
- how to execute tests in parallel since only one branch can be active at a time
- how to organise and setup scenario, and not to overcomplicate it
- subprocess cannot handle quoted command parts
- nested git conflicts
- to have multiple repos per scenario
